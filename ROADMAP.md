# Visionary SaaS - PR & Development Roadmap

## Project Overview
Visionary is a high-end, AI-first SaaS platform designed to help couples visualize, plan, and manifest their dream retirement. By combining financial reality checks with generative AI vision boarding, Visionary offers a unique emotional and practical approach to retirement planning.

## 1. Public Relations (PR) Plan

### Target Audience
- **Primary:** Affluent couples aged 45-60 planning for retirement.
- **Secondary:** Financial Advisors looking for engagement tools for clients.
- **Niche:** Expats planning to retire abroad (e.g., Thailand, Portugal).

### Key Messaging
- "See your future before you spend it."
- "The first financial tool that understands your dreams, not just your dollars."
- "Powered by Gemini 2.5: The world's most advanced AI for life planning."

### Campaign Phases

#### Phase 1: The "Dream Gap" (Launch Week)
- **Press Release:** Announce Visionary as the solution to the "Dream Gap" (the disconnect between financial savings and lifestyle vision).
- **Asset:** "The Thailand Experiment" - A case study of Milton and Lisa Overton using the platform to visualize their beach-front retirement.
- **Channels:** LinkedIn, TechCrunch (AI vertical), AARP Magazine, Financial Planning Journals.

#### Phase 2: User Stories & Virality (Month 1-3)
- **Feature:** "Vision Board Challenge" - Users share their generated AI vision boards on social media with #MyVisionaryFuture.
- **Influencer Strategy:** Partner with retirement coaches and financial influencers on YouTube/Instagram to demo the "Voice-to-Vision" feature.

#### Phase 3: B2B Integration (Month 3-6)
- **Partnership Announcement:** Integration with major wealth management platforms (e.g., Fidelity, Vanguard APIs) to pull real-time data.

## 2. Development Roadmap (Future Scope)

### v1.1: Enhanced Interactivity (Immediate)
- [x] **Voice Dictation:** Capture vision statements naturally (Completed).
- [ ] **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Have the AI "Coach" speak back to the user for a more immersive therapy-like session.
- [ ] **Smart Navigation:** Auto-suggest next steps based on chat sentiment.

### v1.2: Deep Financial Intelligence
- [ ] **Document Parsing:** Use Gemini 2.5 Pro to actually read uploaded PDF financial plans and extract data points (currently simulated).
- [ ] **Real-time Market Data:** Integrate live stock/bond market data to adjust projections dynamically.
- [ ] **Cost of Living API:** When a user says "Thailand", automatically pull real-time housing and food costs for that region to adjust the "Goal" target.

### v2.0: The Immersive Vision Board
- [ ] **Gemini Live Integration:** Full real-time, interruptible voice conversation with the AI Coach.
- [ ] **Video Generation:** Use Veo to generate a 10-second video of the couple walking on the beach in Thailand, not just a static image.
- [ ] **Face Mapping 2.0:** Improved consistency of user identity across multiple generated scenarios (kitchen, garden, travel).

### v3.0: Enterprise & Social
- [ ] **Collaborative Mode:** Allow spouses to log in from separate devices and "merge" their vision boards.
- [ ] **Advisor Portal:** A dashboard for financial advisors to view their clients' vision boards and goals.
- [ ] **VR Experience:** Export the vision board to a VR headset to "step into" the retirement home.

## 3. Technical Requirements for Next Steps
- **Gemini Live API:** For v2.0 conversational features.
- **Google Cloud Storage:** For secure, long-term storage of user financial documents and generated images.
- **Stripe Integration:** For SaaS subscription billing (Premium vs Free tier).
- **Auth0/Clerk:** For secure user authentication and profile management.
